# IFTTT (but for humans)

A simple IF... THEN... planner for humans. It aims to help track and convert bad habits into good ones.

## Why it works

If-Then planning came out of research into motivation, proposing an effective solution to the pitfalls of goal pursuit. It’s all about giving goals greater precision.

If-Then planning has been recognised in over 100 studies to be highly effective when it comes to resisting temptation and forming good habits, increasing your chances of reaching your goal by up to 300%.

If-Then plans (Gollwitzer 1999), where people commit themselves to doing a certain thing in a specific situation are commonly used in health psychology. These self-made plans capture pre-specified responses if a certain situation occurs. Deciding such things in advance reduces the demands you put on your willpower.

### If-then plans go like this:

When setting a goal you need to specify not only what you will do but also where and when you will do it.

If (or when) [___situation__], then I will do [___behaviour__]

So going back to our goal about managing distraction, we need to know much more about the ‘how’ and the ‘what’; we need to inject more detail. For example:

If I’m distracted [by someone talking to me when I’m concentrating], then [I’ll politely ask them to stop].

This may sound a bit cumbersome to start with but research suggests far more goals are achieved by using If-Then planning. And the clever bit is that this builds self talk at the same time. You do what you are telling yourself to do. The If-Then plan succeeds because the situation and the action become linked in your mind. The brain recognises the situation as an opportunity to advance the goal. When the situation is detected, action is initiated automatically. If-Then plans are a good way of making new habits stick.

## Remember !

- **Do not fear fear itself.**
- Pain is a protector.
- Fear is a guard dog for your needs.
- **All feelings are imperfect signals about met/unmet needs.**
- Our fundamental human needs are: physical needs, social needs, "becoming a better person" needs.
- **Healthy people don't "cope" with emotions, they _collaborate_ with them. They use "negative" emotions as clues, constructive criticism to improve their lives.**
- If your fear guard-dog is too hyperactive, don't shoot the dog! Retrain it by forming habits.
- **Habit = When X, Then Y.**
- To form habits, have a consistent "When" and simple "Then". Track your progress for ~66 days. One habit at a time.
- Physical health affects mental health & vice versa. Hardware affects software, software affects hardware.
- **9 Mental Health Habits for your software & hardware:** Meditation, Journaling, Sleep, Exercise, Eat, Talk with friends, Make new friends, Learning, Practicing virtues.

# Habits 101

To train a dog, first: don't beat the dog. Don't fear fear itself.

So, what then, are you supposed to buy one of those clickers and train your own mind with operant conditioning?

## Habits.

Here's a quick summary of the science of forming habits.

1. **Habit = When X, Then Y.**  
   X is the "cue", Y is the "routine". Example: "when I come out of the shower, then I will floss my teeth."

2. **To build a habit, have a consistent When.**  
   Example: if you're trying to eat healthier, don't just say "I'll eat more fruits". Give yourself a specific time and/or place, like, "after I have lunch at home I will have a piece of fruit". (Also known in psychology as an Implementation Intention. [http://kops.uni-konstanz.de/bitstream/handle/123456789/10101/99Goll_ImpInt.pdf])

3. **To build a habit, have a simple Then.**  
   Example: if you're new to meditation, don't start with "meditate for 30 minutes a day." Start with "meditate for 2 minutes a day." Once 2 minutes becomes habit, then you can increase it.

4. **To break a habit, change the When or Then:**  
   Example: to stop myself from procrastinating, I use apps to block tempting websites. (Odysseus tied himself to the mast to resist the sirens' song.)

5. **Track your progress.**  
   Personally: for each day I successfully do my When→Then plan, I draw an ⭕ on a calendar. If I fail, I draw an ❌.

> Do NOT try building more than one habit at a time.

### It takes 66 days (on average) for a habit to become automatic.

Be patient! Mind-training takes time, but it's worth it.



# 9 Evidence-Based Mental Health Habits

This list is to help you start improving your mental health _today._ Nine sounds overwhelming, so just pick _one_ habit from the list below, make a small, simple When→Then plan, and track your progress for 66 days or until it becomes automatic. Then come back, pick another habit, repeat.

## Habits to get to know your wolf better

### 😌 Meditation:

Yeah it's a cliché at this point, but meditation's been shown in meta-analyses to [improve anxiety & depression](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/article-abstract/1809754).

However, there's one cliché about meditation worth dispelling: the goal is _NOT_ "clear your mind". Classic beginner mistake! The goal is to _observe_ your mind, like a scientist: non-judgmentally. When the wolf starts howling – and it will – don't fear fear. Just listen. Observe.

Though I was critiquing "mindfulness" earlier (or my mis-implementation of it), meditation actually _is_ profoundly helpful to my life.

**Example When→Then plan:** _“After brushing my teeth in the morning, I will go to the living room and set a timer to meditate for 2 minutes.”_

Recommended: [this 2-minute animated intro to meditation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqoxYKtEWEc).

### 📓 Journaling:

Another cliché, but writing about your emotions has been shown to moderately [improve psychological _and physical_ health [pdf]](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.518.1710&rep=rep1&type=pdf). Though, you have to write about your emotions _and try to understand them_. Expressing emotions without cognitive sense-making [seems to not help [pdf]](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Philip_Ullrich/publication/11212874_Journaling_about_stressful_events_Effects_of_cognitive_processing_and_emotional_expression/links/0fcfd5090027dd0d0a000000.pdf).

Not sure how to begin journaling to understand your emotions? Here's a simple template:

_"Today when [event], I felt [feeling] because it seemed to fulfill/challenge my need for [need]. Next time, I'll try [experiments around that need]."_

(As much as I criticized "challenging your thoughts" earlier, _this_ is where CBT shines. Knowing [common cognitive distortions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_distortion) and how to reframe them _does_ help you make sense of the Pain signals. Just don't approach it like Debate Club, where the point of the game is to "win" by Well, Actually-ing your fear. The goal should be to help your fear _be a better helper_. Help it help you.)

**Example When→Then plan:** _“Before going to sleep, I will write/draw about my feelings for 10 minutes.”_

・・・

Remember, fear is a guard dog for your needs. If you hear it barking "we're in danger!" but with no _specific_ cause, it's likely your _general_ physical needs are not being fully met. To reassure your inner dog, _you_ can take care of those needs:

## Habits to protect your physical needs:

### 😴 Sleep:

If natural selection decided to knock you out unconscious for a third of your life, you'd better _bet_ there's a huge benefit to make that cost/benefit analysis work out.



**Example When→Then plan:** _“When it's 10pm, I will turn off all my devices, and put them on charger, outside the bedroom, in a trash can, where they belong.”_


### 🏃‍♀️ Exercise:

Jog. Hike. Play Frisbee. Just half an hour of moderate exercise a day is enough to give great benefits to your physical _and mental_ health. [A recent meta-analysis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022395616300383) shows that exercise reduces depression _as much as_ than psychotherapy or medication!

**Example When→Then plan:** _“After getting home in the evening, I'll go for a 10 minute stroll.”_ (Remember: you can always increase duration/intensity of a habit later)

### 🍆 Eat:

Your gut bacteria makes 90% of your body's serotonin. So: you keep your microbes happy, they keep you happy, capiche? (See: this [Mental Health Foundation report](https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/publications/feeding-minds))

There's a zillion diets out there, but most of them aren't based on science... and the science is full of failed replications and p-hacking. Personally, I go with Michael Pollan's anti-diet diet: [Eat food, not too much, mostly plants](https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780143114963/Michael-Pollan/Defense-Food).

**Example When→Then plan:** _“Before grocery shopping, I'll eat a fruit so I'm not hungry and won't get tempted to buy chocolate-flavored Cheetos. Again.”_

・・・

Our physical needs are essential, but we're not just animals, we're _social_ animals. So, if your guard dog barks "nobody likes us!" you can reassure it with these habits:

## Habits to protect your social needs:

High-quality social connections, not surprisingly, [reduces depression and anxiety [pdf]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3455910/pdf/11524_2006_Article_44.pdf). And "surprisingly", it even [reduces your risk of an early death by 50%](https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1000316&mod=article_inline). (Again, it shouldn't _still_ be surprising that hardware affects software and software affects hardware)

### 👯‍♂️ Talk To Friends

Some anecdote-not-data advice:

1.  Whenever _possible:_ Real-Life Face-To-Face > Videochat > Phone Call > Text/Email.
2.  Meet with friends _outside_ your usual context. Examples: meet a friend from work _outside_ work, go with housemates _out_ to a movie. Otherwise, you'll probably lose touch after leaving the job or house.
3.  Because everyone's a busy bee who lives in a rectangular beehive called a calendar, _regularly schedule friend-hangouts_. Make friendship a _habit_, for both of you!

Also, talk about your thoughts & feelings with pals! Besides strengthening the friendship, I suspect sharing your feelings with another person improves your mental health the same way journaling does: explaining your emotions makes you understand your own emotions.

**Example When→Then plan:** _“Every first Monday of the month, I'll video-call my good friend who's in the distant, faraway land of New Haven, CT.”_

### 🎳 Make New Friends

Option 1: Ask friends to introduce you to their friends. (e.g: you all go to a movie together)

Option 2: Join a class or volunteer group or bowling league on [Meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/). (They're not paying me to say this.) I work independently and just moved to a new city, so it could've been super lonely, but Meetup helped me make new friends fast! Just remember to also meet your new friends _outside_ of the meetup.

**Example When→Then plan:** _“Every Thursday evening, I'll go to the French Meetup pour pratiquer mon terrible français.”_

・・・

Finally – our physical and social needs are essential, but we're not just social animals, we're _persons_. So, if your dog barks "we're terrible, evil, broken!", you can reassure it with these habits:

## Habits to protect your "becoming a better person" needs:

The last decade of ["the science of happiness"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_psychology) has been all about how happiness is not enough.

Researchers now identify [two kinds of well-being [pdf]](http://www.preptheday.com/uploads/1/2/0/0/120050120/hedonia_eudaimonia_and_well-being.pdf) – **Hedonia**, which is pleasure & fun, and **Eudaimonia**, which is purpose & fulfillment. The two aren't opposed, but they are different. And of course, [eudamonia predicts better psychological & physical health [pdf]](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Veronika_Huta/publication/23545617_Living_well_A_self-determination_theory_perspective_on_eudaimonia/links/546ce1330cf26e95bc3ca838/Living-well-A-self-determination-theory-perspective-on-eudaimonia.pdf).

So, how do you find the meaning of life? Dunno, that's a question for philosophers. However, you can find _many_ meaning(s) _in_ life, like being a good friend, raising a child, volunteering for a cause... and pushing yourself to your fullest human potential, with habits like:

### 💭 Learning

[Draw on the right side of your brain](https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781585429202). [Play your ukelele](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7Kn1olXCfM). [Understand quantum computing](https://quantum.country/qcvc). [Flirt in French](https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780385348119). [Split apples in half with your bare hands](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPNTutAtbSU). [Make plushies](https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781454703648). [Learn Morse code](https://epxx.co/morse/koch.html). [Try a new team sport on Meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/find/sports-fitness/). [Make chiptunes](https://beepbox.co/). [Learn Python programming](https://www.dataquest.io/course/python-for-data-science-fundamentals/). Play "explorable explanations" about [game theory](https://ncase.me/trust/), [music composition](https://learningmusic.ableton.com/), [fourier transforms](http://www.jezzamon.com/fourier/index.html), [and more](https://explorabl.es/). [Cook](https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781476753836).

Just pick _something_ and set aside a day of the week (or hour of the day) to read a book, or [deliberately practice](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Practice_(learning_method)#Deliberate_practice>) a skill.

**Example When→Then plan:** _“Every Sunday evening, I'll try cooking a new recipe.”_

Recommended: Spaced Repetition ("flashcards on steroids") to help you remember what you learn. See [this 7-minute video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVajQPuRmk8) or [this 80-minute long essay](http://augmentingcognition.com/ltm.html).

### 😇 “It Builds Character”

Benjamin Franklin was the first lifehacker. In-between experimenting with lightning and fighting to abolish slavery, he also strived to improve his moral character with the help of... index cards. [As described in his autobiography](https://www.thesimpledollar.com/ben-franklins-thirteen-virtues-using-one-week-to-change-your-life/): he carried a card with 7 columns – one for each day of the week – and 13 rows – one for each Virtue he wanted to work on. At the end of each day, he'd draw a dot for each Virtue he'd successfully practiced that day. He failed a lot. But over time, he got the crooked timbre of his human nature a little less crooked.

I think we all can, too. You don't have to use Franklin's exact method. In fact, I recommend being more specific than "practice Humilty", and have a specific When→Then plan, like:

**Example When→Then plan:** _“When I'm about to post something angry on the internet, I will wait one hour before hitting Send.”_

“Be the change you want to see in the world” etc etc.

・・・

Know your wolf.  
Physical needs.  
Social needs.  
Becoming a better person.

What helps you meet _all_ of these at the same time: **making fear your friend.** Building a healthier collaboration with your fear (know the wolf) will help you get better at protecting yourself (physical needs), be more vulnerable with trusted friends (social needs), and let you improve your moral character ("becoming a better person" needs).
